- CI/CD: The initial setup doesn't include CI/CD. However, GitHub Actions is planned for automated testing and deployment, streamlining the development workflow.
API Integration: Custom API tools were developed for state management, although React Query could be an alternative for more complex cases. The app displays 8 elements by default due to the API's limitations on trending movie selections.
UI Choices: Titles are displayed instead of posters in search results for a smoother experience, considering the potential bandwidth and performance impact of loading high-resolution images.
